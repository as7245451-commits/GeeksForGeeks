# 💚 GeeksforGeeks DSA Journey (Java)

### Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms through consistency, clarity, and Java ☕

This repository documents my complete problem-solving journey on **GeeksforGeeks**, where I practice and refine **DSA concepts using Java**.  
The focus is not just on solving problems, but on building strong fundamentals and developing an interview-ready mindset.
